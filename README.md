# About the project

This project is starting as a MVP for improving my quality of life during my workouts in the gym.
The idea consists of a "partner" that will help me track the exercises I should do and assist with tracking repetitions and rest time.
The core functionalities are being developed in the following order:
- Workout tracking
- Exercise management
- Build workout

Some really interesting functionalities for the future are:
- Database storage
- WORKOUT ANALYTICS
- Login and account management
- Trainer and athlete relation
- Probably a subscription
